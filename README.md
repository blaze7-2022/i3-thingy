--i3--
Put the 'config' into ~/.config/i3/config
replace the old config with this one

--Polybar--
Put the 'config.ini' file into ~/.config/polybar/config.ini
Create the file if it doesn't exist yet
Also put the 'launch.sh' script if you want polybar to start every X session

--Picom--
X11 doesn't come with many effects by default, this is why you have to install a separate compositor like picom
You will put 'picom.conf' into ~/.config/picom/picom.conf
Create the directories if they don't exist

Thanks for using!
